## A preview into my life

Hi, I'm Kyle.

Others would describe me as a very kind and compassionate individual. I am a persevering student that wants to spread a positive message throughout the world. I'm currently 19 years old with a bit of Linux, Python, and Ethical hacking knowledge. I also have a minor in Finance and am currently on an accelerated path to graduate in college. My hobbies consist of video games, stocks, and networking. I am working towards multiple certifications:

* CompTIA A+
* CompTIA Net+
* CompTIA Sec+
* Cisco certs CCNA or CySa+

Anyways, I am really passionate about my PC and the way my setup looks. Here's a picture to contain your wandering thoughts:

I take my work very seriously whether it ranges from school work to working towards my degree. I like to show others one of my unofficial

that I spent a good amount of time working on. By no means is this my official one that I would use to apply to large corporations or anything involving with my career, but I feel like it's a great resume to look at. I am currently searching for a pet to relieve my emotions and I believe having a support animal would be a great thing to have. I also take love with someone very seriously. I am looking to grow old with someone and it's honestly just the thing I want most in life. 

I also really like to watch dramas and anime. Some notable shows that I love are geared towards romance and comedy. My favorite ones would be:

* __[A Silent Voice](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28851/Koe_no_Katachi)__
* __[86](https://myanimelist.net/anime/41457/86)__
* __[Suzume](https://myanimelist.net/anime/50594/Suzume_no_Tojimari)__
* __[Your Lie In April](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23273/Shigatsu_wa_Kimi_no_Uso)__

I used to be into loads of sports. My favorite sports were swimming, tennis, and wrestling. I also played piano for several years and was actually quite decent at it. I honestly wish I continued to play, but my family decided to sell our piano as no one seemed to be playing it.
