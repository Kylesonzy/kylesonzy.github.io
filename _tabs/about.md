# A preview into my life

Hi, I'm Kyle.

Others would describe me as a very kind and compassionate individual. I am a persevering student that wants to spread a positive message throughout the world. I'm currently 19 years old with a bit of Linux, Python, and Ethical hacking knowledge. I also have a minor in Finance and am currently on an accelerated path to graduate in college. My hobbies consist of video games, stocks, and networking. I am working towards multiple certifications:

* CompTIA A+
* CompTIA Net+
* CompTIA Sec+
* Cisco certs CCNA or CySa+

Anyways, I am really passionate about my PC and the way my setup looks. Here's a picture to contain your wandering thoughts:
